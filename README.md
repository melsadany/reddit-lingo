## Lingo

Originally built from the MEAN Stack:

- **M**ongoDB : Document database – used by your back-end application to store its data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) documents
- **E**xpress (sometimes referred to as Express.js): Back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js
- **A**ngular (formerly Angular.js): Front-end web app framework; runs your JavaScript code in the user's browser, allowing your application UI to be dynamic
- **N**ode.js : JavaScript runtime environment – lets you implement your application back-end in JavaScript

Create new Assessment (component)

cd into ScreenerVersion2/src/app/assessments-module (module that contains the assessment components)

run ../../../node_modules/.bin/ng g component

This generates the files for a new angular component and updates the Angular app classes which need to know about its existence
